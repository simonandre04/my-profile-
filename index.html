    <p>Hello, 
I'm a first-year student at IESEG and I was in the CPGE Commerce in 2022/2023. I am intrigued by the world of finance and industry, which are two worlds I was able to discover during an internship and when I took up a position at Isover Saint-Gobain in August 2023. These experiences enabled me to deepen my professional path and to be filled with conviction and ambition in my future specialisation. I enjoy working in a group and developing team spirit through a social dimension. I was also able to develop this aspect by working as a medical secretary for 2 months.</p>
